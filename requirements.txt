To build and run the ESP32 web server project that interfaces with a DHT11 sensor, youâ€™ll need the following:

Hardware Components:
An ESP32 development board.
A DHT11 temperature and humidity sensor.
A 10k Ohm pull-up resistor (if using the sensor without a module).
A breadboard and jumper wires for connections.
Software and Libraries:
Arduino IDE installed on your computer.
The WiFi.h library for connecting the ESP32 to a Wi-Fi network.
The WebServer.h library to create the web server.
The DHT.h library for interfacing with the DHT11 sensor.
Network Credentials:
SSID and password of the Wi-Fi network you want to connect the ESP32 to.
Power Supply:
A micro USB cable to power the ESP32 board.
