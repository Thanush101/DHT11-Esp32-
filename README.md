# DHT11-Esp32-
This ESP32 code sets up a web server displaying real-time DHT11 sensor data on a webpage and provides a JSON endpoint for temperature and humidity readings.
Ideal for IoT projects and learning web integration with microcontrollers.
The ESP32 connects to a Wi-Fi network and serves a webpage that updates the sensor readings every 2 seconds using JavaScript.
The server also provides a JSON endpoint for the sensor data, which can be used by other applications or services.
